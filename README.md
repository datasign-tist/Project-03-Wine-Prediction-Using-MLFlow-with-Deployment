# Project 03: Wine Prediction Using MLFlow with Deployment

This repository contains a comprehensive end-to-end data science project that follows a complete machine learning lifecycle pipeline. It leverages tools such as DagsHub for version control and collaboration and MLflow for experiment tracking and model management and includes deployment capabilities locally and on AWS.

## Steps to construct the folder structure and required files.

1. Create the template.py file --> This will help us avoid manually adding all the folders and files required.
2. Create the requirements.txt ( pip install -r requirements.txt) --> That contains all the required libraries needed, and it will install them in one go.
3. Create the setup.py --> requirement.txt file will look for this file to install our package as a local package.
4. Add the Logging Functionality in the constructor file inside src/project_name --> This customer logging function will help us debug and track our code when deployed in remote servers.
5. Add the common.py file inside utils --> The Utility file helps us reuse the function ( Professional OOps Programming ). We have used the config-box and ensure-annotation for better standard coding.
